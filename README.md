Missing Number Finder:
Welcome to the Missing Number Finder repository! This project is designed to help users identify missing numbers within a given range from an input list of integers. Whether you're dealing with a small dataset or a large list of numbers, this tool efficiently scans through the provided integers, detects any missing numbers in the sequence, and returns those numbers in a concise format. If the list is complete with no numbers missing, the tool will simply return -1.

Features:
•	Efficient Missing Number Detection: Utilizes a HashSet for O(1) lookup times, ensuring a fast and efficient detection of missing numbers within a given range.
•	Scalable: Capable of handling large datasets with excellent time complexity.
•	User-Friendly: Simple and straightforward use, requiring only the input list to start the detection process.
•	Versatile: Works with any list of integers within the range [0, n], where 'n' is the maximum value that should be present in the list.

How It Works:
The Missing Number Finder takes an input list of integers that span a specific numerical range from 0 to n, inclusive. It identifies any and all integers that are absent from this specified range, even when the list contains duplicates. If the list is complete, the tool signifies this by returning
 -1.

Installation:
No installation is required! You can run the Python script directly in any environment that supports Python 3.x.

Usage:
To use the Missing Number Finder, simply clone this repository or copy the Python script to your local environment. Then, run the script and provide your input list of integers. Here's a quick example:

from missing_number_finder import find_missing_numbers
# Your input list
input_list = [3, 3, 0, 1]
# Find missing numbers
missing_numbers = find_missing_numbers(input_list)
# Print the result
print(missing_numbers)

Example Inputs and Outputs:

•	Input: [3, 3, 0, 1]
Output: [2]
•	Input: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: -1
•	Input: [0, 2]
Output: [1]
•	Input: [5, 0, 1]
Output: [2, 3, 4]
